In the time domain, signal is represented as a function of time, showing how its amplitude varies over time

In the frequency domain, a signal is represented in terms of its constituent frequencies and their amplitudes (powers)
The FD shows the power distribution across different frequencies -> identifying oscillatory components in the signal

Welch's method computes the PSD of an EEG signal, estimating the power distribution across frequencies. The PSD is in the freq domain & represents the strength of different frequency components in the signal.

Band powrs - integrates the PSD over specific frequency bands, producing spectral features representing the power within each band. These features are derived from the frequency domain (capture the frequency content of the signal). 

Fourier transform: any time-domain signal can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoidal waves of various frequencies, each with a specific amplitude and phase.
