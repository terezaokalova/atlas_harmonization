Power Spectra and Neural Oscillations:

A power spectrum (specifically Power Spectral Density or PSD) shows how the power of a signal is distributed across different frequencies
It's computed by taking the Fourier transform of a time-domain signal to convert it to the frequency domain, then squaring the magnitude
Neural oscillations appear as peaks in the power spectrum at specific frequencies, representing rhythmic brain activity
The power spectrum works in the frequency domain, not time domain, showing frequency content averaged over time
